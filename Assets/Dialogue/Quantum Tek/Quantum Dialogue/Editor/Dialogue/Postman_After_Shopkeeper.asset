    MessageText: You know Kristoff, the reindeer guy? I saw the shopkeeper yelling
      at him yesterday. Totally undeserved, because Kristoff seems like such a nice
      guy. Don't tell him I said that though. It's, uh. Embarassing.

    MessageText: Nah, don't worry about it. I mean....some of it seems sentimental
      and stuffs. But I really don't want to deliver the letters to him. He might
